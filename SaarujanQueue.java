/** Queue Class
* Description: A variation of a normal queue, with a capacity; if it exceeds the capacity, the first value will be dequeued
*
* constructor() - Initializes values to null, and length to 0; the default capacity is 10
* constructor(Byte) - Sets the capacity to the given capacity, and head to null, length to 0
* constructor(Node) - Sets the head to the given node, and calculates the length, using the given Node; sets capacity to 10, as default
* enqueue(String) - Adds the given string to the end of the queue; if the length exceeds the capacity after adding the new value, 
*				    the first value is dequeued and returned
* dequeue() - Removes the first value of the queue and returns it
* remove(String) - Removes the given value from the queue; if it doesnâ€™t exist inside the queue, the method returns false
* length() - Returns the length of the queue
* toString() - Returns the queue as a string, containing every value in the queue
